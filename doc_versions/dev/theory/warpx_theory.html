<p>The mesh refinement methods that have been implemented in WarpX were developed following the following principles: i) avoidance of spurious effects from mesh refinement, or minimization of such effects; ii) user controllability of the spurious effectsâ relative magnitude; iii) simplicity of implementation. The two main generic issues that were identified are: a) spurious self-force on macroparticles close to the mesh refinement interface (J. Vay, Colella, et al. 2002; Colella and Norgaard 2010); b) reflection (and possible amplification) of short wavelength electromagnetic waves at the mesh refinement interface (Vay 2001). The two effects are due to the loss of translation invariance introduced by the asymmetry of the grid on each side of the mesh refinement interface.</p>
<p>In addition, for some implementations where the field that is computed at a given level is affected by the solution at finer levels, there are cases where the procedure violates the integral of Gaussâ Law around the refined patch, leading to long range errors (J. Vay, Colella, et al. 2002; Colella and Norgaard 2010). As will be shown below, in the procedure that has been developed in WarpX, the field at a given refinement level is not affected by the solution at finer levels, and is thus not affected by this type of error.</p>
<div class="section" id="electrostatic">
<h2>Electrostatic<a class="headerlink" href="#electrostatic" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h2>
<p>A cornerstone of the Particle-In-Cell method is that assuming a particle lying in a hypothetical infinite grid, then if the grid is regular and symmetrical, and if the order of field gathering matches the order of charge (or current) deposition, then there is no self-force of the particle acting on itself: a) anywhere if using the so-called âmomentum conservingâ gathering scheme; b) on average within one cell if using the âenergy conservingâ gathering scheme (Birdsall and Langdon 1991). A breaking of the regularity and/or symmetry in the grid, whether it is from the use of irregular meshes or mesh refinement, and whether one uses finite difference, finite volume or finite elements, results in a net spurious self-force (which does not average to zero over one cell) for a macroparticle close to the point of irregularity (mesh refinement interface for the current purpose) (J. Vay, Colella, et al. 2002; Colella and Norgaard 2010).</p>
<p>A sketch of the implementation of mesh refinement in WarpX is given in Figure&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="#fig:ESAMR">1</a> (left). Given the solution of the electric potential at a refinement level <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(L_n\)</span>, it is interpolated onto the boundaries of the grid patch(es) at the next refined level <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(L_{n+1}\)</span>. The electric potential is then computed at level <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(L_{n+1}\)</span> by solving the Poisson equation. This procedure necessitates the knowledge of the charge density at every level of refinement. For efficiency, the macroparticle charge is deposited on the highest level patch that contains them, and the charge density of each patch is added recursively to lower levels, down to the lowest.</p>

<p>The presence of the self-force is illustrated on a simple test case that was introduced in (J. Vay, Colella, et al. 2002) and also used in (Colella and Norgaard 2010): a single macroparticle is initialized at rest within a single refinement patch four cells away from the patch refinement boundary. The patch at level <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(L_1\)</span> has <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(32\times32\)</span> cells and is centered relative to the lowest <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(64\times64\)</span> grid at level <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(L_0\)</span> (âmain gridâ), while the macroparticle is centered in one direction but not in the other. The boundaries of the main grid are perfectly conducting, so that the macroparticle is attracted to the closest wall by its image. Specular reflection is applied when the particle reaches the boundary so that the motion is cyclic. The test was performed with WarpX using either linear or quadratic interpolation when gathering the main grid solution onto the refined patch boundary. It was also performed using another method from P. McCorquodale et al (labeled âMCâ in this paper) based on the algorithm given in (Mccorquodale et al. 2004), which employs a more elaborate procedure involving two-ways interpolations between the main grid and the refined patch. A reference case was also run using a single <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(128\times128\)</span> grid with no refined patch, in which it is observed that the particle propagates toward the closest boundary at an accelerated pace, is reflected specularly at the boundary, then slows down until it reaches its initial position at zero velocity. The particle position histories are shown for the various cases in Fig. <a class="reference external" href="#fig:ESselfforce">2</a>. In all the cases using the refinement patch, the particle was spuriously reflected near the patch boundary and was effectively trapped in the patch. We notice that linear interpolation performs better than quadratic, and that the simple method implemented in WarpX performs better than the other proposed method for this test (see discussion below).</p>

</div>
<p>The magnitude of the spurious self-force as a function of the macroparticle position was mapped and is shown in Fig. <a class="reference external" href="#fig:ESselfforcemap">3</a> for the WarpX and MC algorithms using linear or quadratic interpolations between grid levels. It is observed that the magnitude of the spurious self-force decreases rapidly with the distance between the particle and the refined patch boundary, at a rate approaching one order of magnitude per cell for the four cells closest to the boundary and about one order of magnitude per six cells beyond. The method implemented in WarpX offers a weaker spurious force on average and especially at the cells that are the closest to the coarse-fine interface where it is the largest and thus matters most.
We notice that the magnitude of the spurious self-force depends strongly on the distance to the edge of the patch and to the nodes of the underlying coarse grid, but weakly on the order of deposition and size of the patch.</p>
<p>A method was devised and implemented in WarpX for reducing the magnitude of spurious self-forces near the coarse-fine boundaries as follows. Noting that the coarse grid solution is unaffected by the presence of the patch and is thus free of self-force, extra âtransitionâ cells are added around the âeffectiveâ refined area.
Within the effective area, the particles gather the potential in the fine grid. In the extra transition cells surrounding the refinement patch, the force is gathered directly from the coarse grid (an option, which has not yet been implemented, would be to interpolate between the coarse and fine grid field solutions within the transition zone so as to provide continuity of the force experienced by the particles at the interface). The number of cells allocated in the transition zones is controllable by the user in WarpX, giving the opportunity to check whether the spurious self-force is affecting the calculation by repeating it using different thicknesses of the transition zones. The control of the spurious force using the transition zone is illustrated in Fig.&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="#fig:ESselfforce">2</a>, where the calculation with WarpX using linear interpolation at the patch interface was repeated using either two or four cells transition regions (measured in refined patch cell units). Using two extra cells allowed for the particle to be free of spurious trapping within the refined area and follow a trajectory that is close to the reference one, and using four extra cells improved further to the point where the resulting trajectory becomes undistinguishable from the reference one.
We note that an alternative method was devised for reducing the magnitude of self-force near the coarse-fine boundaries for the MC method, by using a special deposition procedure near the interface (Colella and Norgaard 2010).</p>

<div class="section" id="electromagnetic">
<h2>Electromagnetic<a class="headerlink" href="#electromagnetic" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h2>
<p>The method that is used for electrostatic mesh refinement is not directly applicable to electromagnetic calculations. As was shown in section 3.4 of (Vay 2001), refinement schemes relying solely on interpolation between coarse and fine patches lead to the reflection with amplification of the short wavelength modes that fall below the cutoff of the Nyquist frequency of the coarse grid. Unless these modes are damped heavily or prevented from occurring at their source, they may affect particle motion and their effect can escalate if trapped within a patch, via multiple successive reflections with amplification.</p>
<p>To circumvent this issue, an additional coarse patch (with the same resolution as the parent grid) is added, as shown in Fig.&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="#fig:ESAMR">1</a>-right and described in (Vay, Adam, and Heron 2004). Both the fine and the coarse grid patches are terminated by Perfectly Matched Layers, reducing wave reflection by orders of magnitude, controllable by the user (Berenger 1996; J.-L. Vay 2002). The source current resulting from the motion of charged macroparticles within the refined region is accumulated on the fine patch and is then interpolated onto the coarse patch and added onto the parent grid. The process is repeated recursively from the finest level down to the coarsest. The Maxwell equations are then solved for one time interval on the entire set of grids, by default for one time step using the time step of the finest grid. The field on the coarse and fine patches only contain the contributions from the particles that have evolved within the refined area but not from the current sources outside the area. The total contribution of the field from sources within and outside the refined area is obtained by adding the field from the refined grid <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(F(r)\)</span>, and adding an interpolation <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(I\)</span> of the difference between the relevant subset <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s\)</span> of the field in the parent grid <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(F(s)\)</span> and the field of the coarse grid <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(F( c )\)</span>, on an auxiliary grid <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(a\)</span>, i.e. <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(F(a)=F(r)+I[F(s)-F( c )]\)</span>. The field on the parent grid subset <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(F(s)\)</span> contains contributions from sources from both within and outside of the refined area. Thus, in effect, there is substitution of the coarse field resulting from sources within the patch area by its fine resolution counterpart. The operation is carried out recursively starting at the coarsest level up to the finest.
An option has been implemented in which various grid levels are pushed with different time steps, given as a fixed fraction of the individual grid Courant conditions (assuming same cell aspect ratio for all grids and refinement by integer factors). In this case, the fields from the coarse levels, which are advanced less often, are interpolated in time.</p>
<p>The substitution method has two potential drawbacks due to the inexact cancellation between the coarse and fine patches of : (i) the remnants of ghost fixed charges created by the particles entering and leaving the patches (this effect is due to the use of the electromagnetic solver and is different from the spurious self-force that was described for the electrostatic case); (ii) if using a Maxwell solver with a low-order stencil, the electromagnetic waves traveling on each patch at slightly different velocity due to numerical dispersion.
The first issue results in an effective spurious multipole field whose magnitude decreases very rapidly with the distance to the patch boundary, similarly to the spurious self-force in the electrostatic case. Hence, adding a few extra transition cells surrounding the patches mitigates this effect very effectively.
The tunability of WarpXâs electromagnetic finite-difference and pseudo-spectral solvers provides the means to optimize the numerical dispersion so as to minimize the second effect for a given application, which has been demonstrated on the laser-plasma interaction test case presented in (Vay, Adam, and Heron 2004).
Both effects and their mitigation are described in more detail in (Vay, Adam, and Heron 2004).</p>
<p>Caustics are supported anywhere on the grid with an accuracy that is set by the local resolution, and will be adequately resolved if the grid resolution supports the necessary modes from their sources to the points of wavefront crossing. The mesh refinement method that is implemented in WarpX has the potential to provide higher efficiency than the standard use of fixed gridding, by offering a path toward adaptive gridding following wavefronts.</p>

<h1>Moving window and optimal Lorentz boosted frame<a class="headerlink" href="#moving-window-and-optimal-lorentz-boosted-frame" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h1>
<p>The simulations of plasma accelerators from first principles are extremely computationally intensive, due to the need to resolve the evolution of a driver (laser or particle beam) and an accelerated particle beam into a plasma structure that is orders of magnitude longer and wider than the accelerated beam. As is customary in the modeling of particle beam dynamics in standard particle accelerators, a moving window is commonly used to follow the driver, the wake and the accelerated beam. This results in huge savings, by avoiding the meshing of the entire plasma that is orders of magnitude longer than the other length scales of interest.</p>
<div class="figure" id="id1">
<img alt="[fig:PIC] A first principle simulation of a short driver beam (laser or charged particles) propagating through a plasma that is orders of magnitude longer necessitates a very large number of time steps. Recasting the simulation in a frame of reference that is moving close to the speed of light in the direction of the driver beam leads to simulating a driver beam that appears longer propagating through a plasma that appears shorter than in the laboratory. Thus, this relativistic transformation of space and time reduces the disparity of scales, and thereby the number of time steps to complete the simulation, by orders of magnitude." src="../_images/Boosted_frame.png" />

</div>
<p>Even using a moving window, however, a full PIC simulation of a plasma accelerator can be extraordinarily demanding computationally, as many time steps are needed to resolve the crossing of the short driver beam with the plasma column. As it turns out, choosing an optimal frame of reference that travels close to the speed of light in the direction of the laser or particle beam (as opposed to the usual choice of the laboratory frame) enables speedups by orders of magnitude (Vay 2007; J -L. Vay et al. 2011). This is a result of the properties of Lorentz contraction and dilation of space and time. In the frame of the laboratory, a very short driver (laser or particle) beam propagates through a much longer plasma column, necessitating millions to tens of millions of time steps for parameters in the range of the BELLA or FACET-II experiments. As sketched in Fig. <a class="reference external" href="#fig:PIC">[fig:PIC]</a>, in a frame moving with the driver beam in the plasma at velocity <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v=\beta c\)</span> (where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(c\)</span> is the speed of light in vacuum), the beam length is now elongated by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\approx(1+\beta)\gamma\)</span> while the plasma contracts by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\gamma\)</span> (where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\gamma=1/\sqrt{1-\beta^2}\)</span> is the relativistic factor associated with the frame velocity). The number of time steps that is needed to simulate a âlongerâ beam through a âshorterâ plasma is now reduced by up to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\approx(1+\beta) \gamma^2\)</span> (a detailed derivation of the speedup is given below).</p>
<p>The modeling of a plasma acceleration stage in a boosted frame
involves the fully electromagnetic modeling of a plasma propagating at near the speed of light, for which Numerical Cerenkov
(Boris and Lee 1973; Haber et al. 1973) is a potential issue, as explained in more details below.
In addition, for a frame of reference moving in the direction of the accelerated beam (or equivalently the wake of the laser),
waves emitted by the plasma in the forward direction expand
while the ones emitted in the backward direction contract, following the properties of the Lorentz transformation.
If one had to resolve both forward and backward propagating
waves emitted from the plasma, there would be no gain in selecting a frame different from the laboratory frame. However,
the physics of interest for a laser wakefield is the laser driving the wake, the wake, and the accelerated beam.
Backscatter is weak in the short-pulse regime, and does not
interact as strongly with the beam as do the forward propagating waves
which stay in phase for a long period. It is thus often assumed that the backward propagating waves
can be neglected in the modeling of plasma accelerator stages. The accuracy of this assumption has been demonstrated by
comparison between explicit codes which include both forward and backward waves and envelope or quasistatic codes which neglect backward waves
(Geddes et al. 2008; Geddes et al. 2009; Cowan et al. 2009).</p>

<p>Assuming that the simulation box is a fixed number of plasma periods long, which implies the use (which is standard) of a moving window following

<h2>Numerical Stability and alternate formulation in a Galilean frame<a class="headerlink" href="#numerical-stability-and-alternate-formulation-in-a-galilean-frame" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h2>
<p>The numerical Cherenkov instability (NCI) (Godfrey 1974)
is the most serious numerical instability affecting multidimensional
PIC simulations of relativistic particle beams and streaming plasmas
(Martins et al. 2010; Vay et al. 2010; J L Vay et al. 2011; Sironi and Spitkovsky 2011; Godfrey and Vay 2013; Xu et al. 2013).
It arises from coupling between possibly numerically distorted electromagnetic modes and spurious
beam modes, the latter due to the mismatch between the Lagrangian
treatment of particles and the Eulerian treatment of fields (Godfrey 1975).</p>
<p>In recent papers the electromagnetic dispersion
relations for the numerical Cherenkov instability were derived and solved for both FDTD (Godfrey and Vay 2013; Brendan B. Godfrey and Vay 2014)
and PSATD (Brendan B. Godfrey, Vay, and Haber 2014a, 2014b) algorithms.</p>
<p>Several solutions have been proposed to mitigate the NCI (Brendan B Godfrey, Vay, and Haber 2014; Brendan B. Godfrey, Vay, and Haber 2014b, 2014a; Godfrey and Vay 2015; Yu, Xu, Decyk, et al. 2015; Yu, Xu, Tableman, et al. 2015). Although
these solutions efficiently reduce the numerical instability,
they typically introduce either strong smoothing of the currents and
fields, or arbitrary numerical corrections, which are
tuned specifically against the NCI and go beyond the
natural discretization of the underlying physical equation. Therefore,
it is sometimes unclear to what extent these added corrections could impact the
physics at stake for a given resolution.</p>
<p>For instance, NCI-specific corrections include periodically smoothing
the electromagnetic field components (Martins et al. 2010),
using a special time step (Vay et al. 2010; J L Vay et al. 2011) or
applying a wide-band smoothing of the current components (Vay et al. 2010; J L Vay et al. 2011; J. Vay, Geddes, et al. 2011). Another set of mitigation methods
involve scaling the deposited
currents by a carefully-designed wavenumber-dependent factor
(Brendan B. Godfrey and Vay 2014; Brendan B. Godfrey, Vay, and Haber 2014b) or slightly modifying the
ratio of electric and magnetic fields (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(E/B\)</span>) before gathering their
value onto the macroparticles
(Brendan B. Godfrey, Vay, and Haber 2014a; Godfrey and Vay 2015).
Yet another set of NCI-specific corrections
(Yu, Xu, Decyk, et al. 2015; Yu, Xu, Tableman, et al. 2015) consists
in combining a small timestep <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Delta t\)</span>, a sharp low-pass spatial filter,
and a spectral or high-order scheme that is tuned so as to
create a small, artificial âbumpâ in the dispersion relation
(Yu, Xu, Decyk, et al. 2015). While most mitigation methods have only been applied
to Cartesian geometry, this last
set of methods ((Yu, Xu, Decyk, et al. 2015; Yu, Xu, Tableman, et al. 2015))
has the remarkable property that it can be applied
(Yu, Xu, Tableman, et al. 2015) to both Cartesian geometry and
quasi-cylindrical geometry (i.e. cylindrical geometry with
azimuthal Fourier decomposition (Lifschitz et al. 2009; Davidson et al. 2015; R. Lehe et al. 2016)). However,
the use of a small timestep proportionally slows down the progress of
the simulation, and the artificial âbumpâ is again an arbitrary correction
that departs from the underlying physics.</p>
<p>A new scheme was recently proposed, in (Kirchen et al. 2016; Lehe et al. 2016), which
completely eliminates the NCI for a plasma drifting at a uniform relativistic velocity
â with no arbitrary correction â by simply integrating
the PIC equations in <em>Galilean coordinates</em> (also known as
<em>comoving coordinates</em>). More precisely, in the new
method, the Maxwell equations <em>in Galilean coordinates</em> are integrated
analytically, using only natural hypotheses, within the PSATD
framework (Pseudo-Spectral-Analytical-Time-Domain (Haber et al. 1973; Vay, Haber, and Godfrey 2013)).</p>
<p>The idea of the proposed scheme is to perform a Galilean change of
coordinates, and to carry out the simulation in the new coordinates:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\label{eq:change-var}
\boldsymbol{x}' = \boldsymbol{x} - \boldsymbol{v}_{gal}t\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\boldsymbol{x} = x\,\boldsymbol{u}_x + y\,\boldsymbol{u}_y + z\,\boldsymbol{u}_z\)</span> and
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\boldsymbol{x}' = x'\,\boldsymbol{u}_x + y'\,\boldsymbol{u}_y + z'\,\boldsymbol{u}_z\)</span> are the
position vectors in the standard and Galilean coordinates
respectively.</p>
<p>When choosing <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\boldsymbol{v}_{gal}= \boldsymbol{v}_0\)</span>, where
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\boldsymbol{v}_0\)</span> is the speed of the bulk of the relativistic
plasma, the plasma does not move with respect to the grid in the Galilean
coordinates <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\boldsymbol{x}'\)</span> â or, equivalently, in the standard
coordinates <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\boldsymbol{x}\)</span>, the grid moves along with the plasma. The heuristic intuition behind this scheme
is that these coordinates should prevent the discrepancy between the Lagrangian and
Eulerian point of view, which gives rise to the NCI (Godfrey 1975).</p>
<p>An important remark is that the Galilean change of
coordinates (<a class="reference external" href="#eq:change-var">[eq:change-var]</a>) is a simple translation. Thus, when used in
the context of Lorentz-boosted simulations, it does
of course preserve the relativistic dilatation of space and time which gives rise to the
characteristic computational speedup of the boosted-frame technique.</p>
<p>Another important remark is that the Galilean scheme is <em>not</em>
equivalent to a moving window (and in fact the Galilean scheme can be
independently <em>combined</em> with a moving window). Whereas in a
moving window, gridpoints are added and removed so as to effectively
translate the boundaries, in the Galilean scheme the gridpoints
<em>themselves</em> are not only translated but in this case, the physical equations
are modified accordingly. Most importantly, the assumed time evolution of
the current <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\boldsymbol{J}\)</span> within one timestep is different in a standard PSATD scheme with moving
window and in a Galilean PSATD scheme (Lehe et al. 2016).</p>
<p>In the Galilean coordinates <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\boldsymbol{x}'\)</span>, the equations of particle
motion and the Maxwell equations take the form</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">

As shown in (Kirchen et al. 2016; Lehe et al. 2016),
the elimination of the NCI with the new Galilean integration is verified empirically via PIC simulations of uniform drifting plasmas and laser-driven plasma acceleration stages, and confirmed by a theoretical analysis of the instability.</p>

<p>Initialization of the plasma columns and drivers (laser or particle beam) is performed via the specification of multidimensional functions that describe the initial state with, if needed, a time dependence, or from reconstruction of distributions based on experimental data. Care is needed when initializing quantities in parallel to avoid double counting and ensure smoothness of the distributions at the interface of computational domains. When the sum of the initial distributions of charged particles is not charge neutral, initial fields are computed using generally a static approximation with Poisson solves accompanied by proper relativistic scalings (Vay 2008; Cowan et al. 2013).</p>
<p>Outputs include dumps of particle and field quantities at regular intervals, histories of particle distributions moments, spectra, etc, and plots of the various quantities.

<p>The input and output data are often known from, or compared to, experimental data. Thus, calculating in
a frame other than the laboratory entails transformations of the data between the calculation frame and the laboratory
frame. This section describes the procedures that have been implemented in the Particle-In-Cell framework Warp (Grote et al. 2005) to handle the input and output of data between the frame of calculation and the laboratory frame (J -L. Vay et al. 2011). Simultaneity of events between two frames is valid only for a plane that is perpendicular to the relative motion of the frame. As a result, the input/output processes involve the input of data (particles or fields) through a plane, as well as output through a series of planes, all of which are perpendicular to the direction of the relative velocity between the frame of calculation and the other frame of choice.</p>

<h4>Particles -<a class="headerlink" href="#particles" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h4>
<p>Particles are launched through a plane using a technique that is generic and applies to Lorentz boosted frame simulations in general, including plasma acceleration, and is illustrated using the case of a positively charged particle beam propagating through a background of cold electrons in an assumed continuous transverse focusing system, leading to a well-known growing transverse âelectron cloudâ instability (Vay 2007). In the laboratory frame, the electron background is initially at rest and a moving window is used to follow the beam progression. Traditionally, the beam macroparticles are initialized all at once in the window, while background electron macroparticles are created continuously in front of the beam on a plane that is perpendicular to the beam velocity. In a frame moving at some fraction of the beam velocity in the laboratory frame, the beam initial conditions at a given time in the calculation frame are generally unknown and one must initialize the beam differently. However, it can be taken advantage of the fact that the beam initial conditions are often known for a given plane in the laboratory, either directly, or via simple calculation or projection from the conditions at a given time in the labortory frame. Given the position and velocity <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\{x,y,z,v_x,v_y,v_z\}\)</span> for each beam macroparticle at time <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t=0\)</span> for a beam moving at the average velocity <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v_b=\beta_b c\)</span> (where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(c\)</span> is the speed of light) in the laboratory, and using the standard synchronization (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(z=z'=0\)</span> at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t=t'=0\)</span>) between the laboratory and the calculation frames, the procedure for transforming the beam quantities for injection in a boosted frame moving at velocity <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\beta c\)</span> in the laboratory is as follows (the superscript <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\('\)</span> relates to quantities known in the boosted frame while the superscript <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(^*\)</span> relates to quantities that are know at a given longitudinal position <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(z^*\)</span> but different times of arrival):</p>

<p>This additional step is needed for setting the electrostatic or electromagnetic fields at the plane of injection. In a Particle-In-Cell code, the three-dimensional fields are calculated by solving the Maxwell equations (or static approximation like Poisson, Darwin or other (Vay 2008)) on a grid on which the source term is obtained from the macroparticles distribution. This requires generation of a three-dimensional representation of the beam distribution of macroparticles at a given time before they cross the injection plane at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(z'^*\)</span>. This is accomplished by expanding the beam distribution longitudinally such that all macroparticles (so far known at different times of arrival at the injection plane) are synchronized to the same time in the boosted frame. To keep the beam shape constant, the particles are âfrozenâ until they cross that plane: the three velocity components and the two position components perpendicular to the boosted frame velocity are kept constant, while the remaining position component is advanced at the average beam velocity. As particles cross the plane of injection, they become regular âactiveâ particles with full 6-D dynamics.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Figure <a class="reference external" href="#Fig_inputoutput">[Fig_inputoutput]</a> (top) shows a snapshot of a beam that has passed partly through the injection plane. As the frozen beam macroparticles pass through the injection plane (which moves opposite to the beam in the boosted frame), they are converted to âactiveâ macroparticles. The charge or current density is accumulated from the active and the frozen particles, thus ensuring that the fields at the plane of injection are consistent.</p>

<h4>Laser -<a class="headerlink" href="#laser" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h4>
<p>Similarly to the particle beam, the laser is injected through a plane perpendicular to the axis of propagation of the laser (by default <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(z\)</span>).
The electric field <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(E_\perp\)</span> that is to be emitted is given by the formula</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[E_\perp\left(x,y,t\right)=E_0 f\left(x,y,t\right) \sin\left[\omega t+\phi\left(x,y,\omega\right)\right]\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(E_0\)</span> is the amplitude of the laser electric field, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(f\left(x,y,t\right)\)</span> is the laser envelope, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\omega\)</span> is the laser frequency, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\phi\left(x,y,\omega\right)\)</span> is a phase function to account for focusing, defocusing or injection at an angle, and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t\)</span> is time. By default, the laser envelope is a three-dimensional gaussian of the form</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[f\left(x,y,t\right)=e^{-\left(x^2/2 \sigma_x^2+y^2/2 \sigma_y^2+c^2t^2/2 \sigma_z^2\right)}\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sigma_x\)</span>, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sigma_y\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sigma_z\)</span> are the dimensions of the laser pulse; or it can be defined arbitrarily by the user at runtime.
If <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\phi\left(x,y,\omega\right)=0\)</span>, the laser is injected at a waist and parallel to the axis <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(z\)</span>.</p>
<p>If, for convenience, the injection plane is moving at constant velocity <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\beta_s c\)</span>, the formula is modified to take the Doppler effect on frequency and amplitude into account and becomes</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{split}\begin{aligned}

<p>The injection of a laser of frequency <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\omega\)</span> is considered for a simulation using a boosted frame moving at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\beta c\)</span> with respect to the laboratory. Assuming that the laser is injected at a plane that is fixed in the laboratory, and thus moving at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\beta_s=-\beta\)</span> in the boosted frame, the injection in the boosted frame is given by</p>

<p>The electric field is then converted into currents that get injected via a 2D array of macro-particles, with one positive and one dual negative macro-particle for each array cell in the plane of injection, whose weights and motion are governed by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(E_\perp\left(x',y',t'\right)\)</span>. Injecting using this dual array of macroparticles offers the advantage of automatically including the longitudinal component that arises from emitting into a boosted frame, and to automatically verify the discrete Gaussâ law thanks to using charge conserving (e.g. Esirkepov) current deposition scheme (Esirkepov 2001).</p>

<h3>Output in a boosted frame simulation<a class="headerlink" href="#output-in-a-boosted-frame-simulation" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h3>
<p>Some quantities, e.g. charge or dimensions perpendicular to the boost velocity, are Lorentz invariant.
Those quantities are thus readily available from standard diagnostics in the boosted frame calculations. Quantities that do not fall in this category are recorded at a number of regularly spaced âstationsâ, immobile in the laboratory frame, at a succession of time intervals to record data history, or averaged over time. A visual example is given on Fig. <a class="reference external" href="#Fig_inputoutput">[Fig_inputoutput]</a> (bottom). Since the space-time locations of the diagnostic grids in the laboratory frame generally do not coincide with the space-time positions of the macroparticles and grid nodes used for the calculation in a boosted frame, some interpolation is performed at runtime during the data collection process. As a complement or an alternative, selected particle or field quantities can be dumped at regular intervals and quantities are reconstructed in the laboratory frame during a post-processing phase. The choice of the methods depends on the requirements of the diagnostics and particular implementations.</p>
